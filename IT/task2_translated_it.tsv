Khaled al-Elwany , a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries , says up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month . Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies . A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation . Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen 's exiled government to power and roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi movement . While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas , a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad . State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos , and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority . The frightened men in the Aden warehouse , subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish-strewn outdoor space , are just the tip of the iceberg ."	migrant	au	261	292	Ma il loro piano non era di esserlo.
